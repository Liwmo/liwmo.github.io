    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p class="about">Hi! I'm a PhD candidate in the School of Information at the
      University of Michigan. As part of the Educational Technology Collaborative
      lab group (link in the side bar), my research lies at the intersection of
      technology and education.</p>

   <p class="about">Specifically, I explore the interaction between how people use machine learning
      and AI systems to make decisions, and how that affects both computer models
      and educational outcomes. We have built predictive models and analyzed
      effects on such systems when students choose to opt-out of sharing their data;
      we also seek to better understand learners' privacy perceptions surrounding
      these decisions. My current work centers around AI-generated explanations
      and how that influences metacognitive judgements (a process where people think
      about their thinking to form opinions about their own knowledge).</p>

   <p class="about">Here, I share some of the educational content I've created over the years from
      my experience teaching both in formal and informal settings: job preparation
      programs, tutoring services, and university teaching. These topics range from
      my prior background in physics and mathematics. I also jot down some current
      musings regarding education and learning analytics (or the other odd topic
      here-and-there). For details about my papers and projects, view the CV and
      "Publications" link above.
