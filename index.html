    <h1>Welcome!</h1>

    <p class="about">I'm a PhD candidate in the School of Information at the
      University of Michigan. As part of the Educational Technology Collaborative
      lab group (link in the side bar), my research lies at the intersection of
      technology and education.</p><br>

   <p class="about">Specifically, I explore the interaction between how people use machine learning
      and AI systems to make decisions, and how that affects both computer models
      and educational outcomes. I've analyzed the effects on grade predictive models when 
      students choose to opt-out of sharing their data, and also seek to better understand 
      learners' privacy perceptions surrounding these decisions. My current work centers 
      around AI-generated explanations and how that influences metacognitive judgements 
      (summarized in the poster above).</p><br>

   <p class="about">Here, I also share some of the educational content I've created over the years from
      my experience teaching both in formal and informal settings, as well as research-related
      musings on education and learning analytics (and occasional miscellany).
