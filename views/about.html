         <h1>About Me</h1> 
         <p> I'm a junior studying compter science, math, and physics (majors subject to change) at the <a href="http://www.umsl.edu"> University of Missouri-St. Louis</a>. I was first exposed to coding when I joined <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/ftc"> FIRST FTC robotics team </a>2867 (go check out this program!) at my high school several years ago. However, it wasn't until my final year that I met a life-changing AP Computer Science teacher who crafted the class into a limitless sandbox of creativity; it was a place to collaborate, compete, and challenge ourselves to see who could build the coolest figurative sandcastle (though I wouldn't mind if we had made literal ones too). Consequently, he inspired me to learn more about CS in college. During this time, I also discovered the beauty and mysteries of physics thanks to a <a href="http://www.umsl.edu/~physics/">fantastic department</a> filled with faculty who take time and effort in both research and teaching. I also currently work as an on-campus tutor at the <a href="http://www.umsl.edu/mathcs/math-academic-center/">Math and Writing Center</a>, trying to spread my knowledge and appreciation of STEM, and trying (then failing again, then getting up, etc.) to reach goals, explore life, and share experiences with others along the way.</p>

         <h2>Stuff on this Webpage</h2> 
         <p> On this humble virtual landing spot in a vast network of information, you will find a collection of my academic pursuits, personal projects, and other miscellaneous thoughts and topics that I choose to ramble about. This is still a work in progress, but hopefully it will grow into a somewhat larger (yet still oddly jumbled) hub to share some interesting stuff. For instance, I might include a food blog, travelogue, mocha yule log, or anything else that jogs my curiosity.
