         <h1>About Me</h1> 
         <p> I'm a junior studying compter science, math, and physics (majors subject to change) at the <a href="http://www.umsl.edu"> University of Missouri-St. Louis</a>. I was first exposed to coding when I joined <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/ftc"> FIRST FTC robotics team </a>2867 (go check out this program!) at my high school several years ago. However, it wasn't until my final year that I met a life-changing AP Computer Science teacher who crafted the class into a limitless sandbox of creativity; it was a place to collaborate, compete, and challenge ourselves to see who could build the coolest figurative sandcastle (though I wouldn't mind if we had made literal ones too). Consequently, he inspired me to learn more about CS in college. During this time, I also discovered the beauty and mysteries of physics thanks to a <a href="http://www.umsl.edu/~physics/">fantastic department</a> filled with faculty who take time and effort in both research and teaching. I also currently work as an on-campus tutor at the <a href="http://www.umsl.edu/mathcs/math-academic-center/">Math and Writing Center</a>, trying to spread my knowledge and appreciation of STEM, and trying (then failing again, then getting up, etc.) to reach goals, explore life, and help others along the way.</p> 
 
         <h2>Stuff on this Webpage</h2> 
         <p> On this humble virtual landing spot in a vast network of information, you will find a collection of my academic pursuits, personal projects, and other miscellaneous thoughts and topics that I choose to ramble about. This is still a work in progress, but hopefully it will grow into a somewhat larger (yet still oddly jumbled) hub to share some interesting stuff. For instance, I might include additions to my repertoire, recipes and restaurants, foreign language materials, and anything else that sparks curiosity.
